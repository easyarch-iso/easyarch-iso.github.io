                is without a doubt one of the most popular linux distribution
                out there. Whoever use it, use it for its simplicity, vast
                collection of latest software and tools. The official and the
                user repository cover almost all application needs of arch
                users. Whoever tries out

                falls in love with it because of this huge collection. But this
                comes with a price. First of all, the official installation
                method is completely terminal based. Even after installation,
                people have to tweak the system to meet their needs because none
                of the packages will provide any special customization or auto
                enabled services. You have to configure and run what you want to
                run yourself. This is actually great for getting more acquainted
                with the packages and the system itself. In the end you will
                have your very own system, which behaves the way you wanted it
                to. Also you need internet connection while installing

                While these are all good for some of us, a lot of people stick
                to the other distributions simply because they don't want to or
                can't afford to follow the installation procedure or all the
                tweaks they have to do themselves. For those people there are
                distributions like
                <a
                  href="https://manjaro.org/"

                based distributions offering custom graphical means to setup.
                But in the end they are heavily customized to the point where
                you will find a lot of differences between the actual Arch and
                them. Its not to say, they aren't any good, its just they are
                not
